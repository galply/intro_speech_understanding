# iM22W7005 LIU TIANLE

This repository contains assignments for the <a
href="https://www.kcg.edu/">KCGI</a> graduate course "Intro to Speech
Understanding."

## Getting Started

Clone the course directory by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/jhasegaw/intro_speech_understanding
```

This will create the directory `intro_speech_understanding`, and will
fill it with all of the code and assignments that have been published so far.

## Weekly Update

Every week, before lecture, `cd` to the directory
`intro_speech_understanding`, and then do the following:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "comment"
git fetch
git merge -m "comment"
```

The command `git add -A` creates a new local record of your work, and
`git commit -m "comment"` puts the local record into your local
history.  By putting your work into your local history, you have made
it possible to use git to recover your file, even if you accidentally
delete it.

The command `git fetch` fetches the new assignments from github.  The
command `git merge -m "comment"` merges the downloaded assignments,
together with your own work, into the directory that's visible on your
own machine.

## Disaster Recovery

When you are new to git, you will often find that git is asking you a
question that you don't know how to answer.

If that happens, the easiest solution is to just go to a completely
new directory, and type `git clone
https://github.com/jhasegaw/intro_speech_understanding` again.  This
will give you a completely new copy of the directory, so you can start over.

## More Information

This course will not give you an extensive tutorial on git, but there
is a lot of information online, e.g., at <a
href="https://git-scm.com/docs/">https://git-scm.com/docs/</a>.

There are also good youtube tutorials, e.g., <a
